Software Design for The Gaming Room:
The Gaming Room is a client that requested a software design for a game application similar to Draw It or Lose It, a turn-based multiplayer game. The goal was to create a design that could scale across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent functionality and performance.

Key Aspects of the Software Design Process
Strengths in Documentation:
One of the strongest aspects of the design documentation was the clear organization and detailed system architecture, which helped ensure both developers and stakeholders had a shared understanding of the project. Additionally, outlining class structures and interactions between components streamlined the development phase.

How the Design Document Aided Development:
Working through the design document helped clarify the scope and functionality of the project before coding began. It allowed for early identification of potential challenges and ensured that development followed a structured approach rather than an ad-hoc process.

Areas for Improvement:
If I were to revise one part, I would improve the user experience (UX) flow diagrams to better visualize the user’s journey through the application. Adding more detailed wireframes or mockups would enhance clarity for both developers and stakeholders.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:
Understanding the client’s requirements was crucial. By breaking down user needs into functional and non-functional requirements, the design ensured an intuitive interface and efficient performance. Prioritizing usability and responsiveness helped align the final product with user expectations.

Approach to Software Design:
The design process involved techniques such as UML diagrams, system architecture planning, and modular design principles to create a scalable application. In the future, I would use more agile methodologies, incorporating iterative feedback cycles to refine the design based on real user testing.
